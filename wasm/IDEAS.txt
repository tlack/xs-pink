Types:

Say up to 127 types
Named at creation
Neg t = scalar

Operators:

Fundamental functions?

Continuous parse transforms on head?


Memory layout:

(Wasm provides one continguous block of memory byte addressible)

Here "int" means we're addressing it as 32 bit ints

Int 0 - Not sure

Int 1..769 - Typedefs? (Fixed amt)

	[ 
		[ Sym "list", Sym "int", Sym "char", .. ],                           1..513
		[ List dispatch ptr, int dispatch ptr, char dispatch ptr.. ]         514..768
	]

	Total size for 64 types: (64*8 512)+(64*4 256)=512+256=768

Int ??? - Dispatch for type "list"
